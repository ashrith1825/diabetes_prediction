# ü©∫ Diabetes Risk Predictor

A **full-stack web application** that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on several key health metrics.  
The project integrates a **pre-trained machine learning model** (served via a Python Flask API) with a **modern React frontend** to provide **instant, data-driven insights** into diabetes risk along with **actionable health advice**.
